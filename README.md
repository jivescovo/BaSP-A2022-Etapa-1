## Week 00

Description: 2 people work teams developed the assigned views. In my case, this view was for an Employee PM role.
In order to do so, we had to make use of overlays, components, variants and interactions.
The other teams had other roles and views to develop. 
One of said views was the landing desktop, which is the basis for the work of the following week.

## Week 01

Description: Using as strarting point the Landing Desktop view developed in Figma during Week 00,
I began writing the plain HTML code that represents it. I made use of tags such as:

    - <div>
    - <aside>
    - <p>
    - <span>
    - <a>
    - <section>
    - <nav>
    - <ul> and <ol>
    - <header> and <footer>
    - And others

The objective of this week is to develop the HTML by itself in order to implement CSS on it the following week.

## Week 02

Description: From the HTML of the week prior, I began fixing the mistakes or adding the missing features detailed
in the previous week feedback. Afterwards I used CSS to give the HTML the styles to make it look like 
the Lading Desktop from the Figma. I made use of the following selectors:

    - Type
    - Class
    - Id
    - Pseudoelements

As before, make sure to download the assets folder but this time, the css and webfonts folders should be downloaded. If this isn't done, neither styles nor icons will be visible.

## Week 03

Description: Starting out from the CSS of the previous week, I adressed the mistakes and lack of prolixity in my code,
mainly in the CSS selectors and properties positions inside the CSS files. 
Following that, I implemented Flexbox into the webiste design so as to make the Landing Desktop as responsive as possible,
taking into account that the design should be Mobile-First. I implemented the views for the follwing devices:

    - Mobile
    - Tablet
    - Desktop

## Week 04

Description: After creating a new HTML file, I began solving the excercises given as homework using JavaScript
and printing their results into the console of the previously created HTML file. Each time a block of code
belonging to a certain set of excercises was completed, I made a commit. The subjects tackled in this week were:

    - Variables and Operators
    - Strings
    - Arrays
    - If Else
    - For
    - Functions
