## Week 00
    Description: 2 people work teams developed the assigned views. In my case, this view was for an Employee PM role. In order to do so, we had to make use of overlays, components, variants and interactions. The other teams had other roles and views to develop. One of said views was the landing desktop, which is the basis for the work of the following week.

## Week 01
    Description: Using as strarting point the Landing Desktop view developed in Figma during Week 00, I began writing the plain HTML code that represents it. I made use of tags such as:

        - <div>
        - <aside>
        - <p>
        - <span>
        - <a>
        - <section>
        - <nav>
        - <ul> and <ol>
        - <header> and <footer>
        - And others

    The objective of this week is to develop the HTML by itself in order to implement CSS on it the following week.

    How to access:
       1 - Access folder "Semana 01"
       2 - Open file "index.html" on your browser (make sure to download the assets folder)

## Week 02
    Description: From the HTML of the week prior, I began fixing the mistakes or adding the missing features detailed in the previous week feedback. Afterwards I used CSS to give the HTML the styles to make it look like the Lading Desktop from the Figma. I made use of the following selectors:

        - Type
        - Class
        - Id
        - Pseudoelements

    How to access:

        1 - Access folder "Semana 02"
        2 - Open file "index.html" on your browser
            
    As before, make sure to download the assets folder but this time, the css and webfonts folders should be downloaded. If this isn't done, neither styles nor icons will be visible.
